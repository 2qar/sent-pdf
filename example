Why?
• PPTX sucks
• LATEX sucks
• PDF sucks

also:

don't support images…

@nyan.png
this text will not be displayed, since the @ at the start of the first line
makes this paragraph an image slide.

easy to use

depends on
♽ Xlib
☢ libpng

~1000 lines of code

usage:
$ sent FILE1 [FILE2 …]

▸ one slide per paragraph
▸ lines starting with # are ignored
▸ image slide: paragraph containing @FILE.png
▸ empty slide: just use a \ as a paragraph

# This is a comment and will not be part of the presentation

# multiple empty lines between paragraphs are also ignored


# The following lines should produce
# one empty slide
